## Features
* Identifies conflicting spaces.
* Very fast lookups even when managing a large number of spaces.
* Supports several types of spaces:
    * Wildcard spaces:
        * `/path/*` - wildcard space - matches all resources in one path depth only.
        * `/path/*/*` - multi-level wildcard space - matches all resources at the given path depth only.
        * `/path/*/*/*` - any number of levels allowed.
    * Unbounded spaces - Allows other sub-spaces to be allocated:
        * `/path/**` - unbounded space - matches all resources at or below one path depth.
        * `/path/*/**` - multi-level unbounded space - matches all resources at or below the given path depth.
        * `/path/*/*/**` - any number of levels allowed.
    * Greedy spaces - Like unbounded spaces, but do not allow other sub-spaces to be allocated:
        * `/path/***` - greedy space - matches all resources at or below one path depth.
        * `/path/*/***` - multi-level greedy space - matches all resources at or below the given path depth.
        * `/path/*/*/***` - any number of levels allowed.
* Small footprint, minimal dependencies - not part of a big monolithic package.
* Java 1.8 implementation:
    * Android compatible.

## Motivation
Managing the URL path space is central to web application development.  When components are developed independently and combined into a single URL space, as well as underlying implementation space (such as Java Servlet paths), it is important that each component occupy a well-defined space without unexpectedly overlapping other components.  The goal is to reliably identify conflicts within an application's URL or implementation space instead of unintentionally having overlapping components or access rules.

[SemanticCMS Core Controller](https://github.com/ao-apps/semanticcms-core-controller) uses this project to manage which requests are passed along for direct processing by the local Servlet container.  This layer of allocating the servlet space is important because resources from `/META-INF/resources/` within all project JAR files are merged into a single space with the potential to inadvertently overlap.  Explicit reservation of servlet space through the controller helps identify these conflicts early in the module development and integration phases.
